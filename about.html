        <p class="lead">
            I am a <strong>Staff Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)</strong> with expertise in <strong>cloud computing, data engineering,</strong> and <strong>big data technologies</strong>. My work revolves around designing and optimizing scalable, reliable, and secure cloud infrastructures using cutting-edge platforms like <strong>Amazon Redshift</strong>, <strong>EMR</strong>, <strong>Kubernetes</strong>, and <strong>serverless architectures</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a strong focus on <strong>distributed systems</strong> and <strong>automation</strong>, I have implemented advanced site reliability engineering practices that enhance the efficiency and resilience of mission-critical systems. My expertise extends beyond SRE to include developing and optimizing <strong>large-scale data pipelines, ETL processes, and data lakes</strong>, enabling real-time analytics across industries like healthcare, finance, and consumer platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am particularly passionate about emerging fields such as <strong>MLOps</strong>, where I integrate machine learning workflows with big data systems. Additionally, I prioritize compliance with stringent <strong>cloud security frameworks</strong>, ensuring that every system I develop meets the highest standards of safety and reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
            My contributions to innovation and technology have a significant impact, facilitating critical decision-making through real-time data insights and supporting the scalability of businesses that drive economic growth. As an advocate for knowledge sharing, I have contributed to <strong>open-source initiatives</strong>, mentored aspiring engineers, and presented insights at professional forums to advance the field.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through my technical expertise and dedication, I aim to continue pushing the boundaries of cloud computing and data engineering, contributing to technological leadership and economic progress.
