                    I am a <strong>Staff Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)</strong> with expertise in cloud computing, data engineering, and big data technologies. My work revolves around designing and optimizing scalable, reliable, and secure cloud infrastructures using cutting-edge platforms like Amazon Redshift, EMR, Kubernetes, and serverless architectures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a strong focus on distributed systems and automation, I have implemented advanced site reliability engineering practices that enhance the efficiency and resilience of mission-critical systems. My expertise extends beyond SRE to include developing and optimizing large-scale data pipelines, ETL processes, and data lakes, enabling real-time analytics across industries like healthcare, finance, and consumer platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am particularly passionate about emerging fields such as <strong>MLOps</strong>, where I integrate machine learning workflows with big data systems. Additionally, I prioritize compliance with stringent cloud security frameworks, ensuring that every system I develop meets the highest standards of safety and reliability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My contributions to innovation and technology have a significant impact, facilitating critical decision-making through real-time data insights and supporting the scalability of businesses that drive economic growth. As an advocate for knowledge sharing, I have contributed to open-source initiatives, mentored aspiring engineers, and presented insights at professional forums to advance the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through my technical expertise and dedication, I aim to continue pushing the boundaries of cloud computing and data engineering, contributing to technological leadership and economic progress.
